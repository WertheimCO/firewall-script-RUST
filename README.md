# firewall-script-RUST

Example of a simple firewall script in Rust that uses the iptables command-line tool to manage iptables rules:

This script uses the Command struct from the std::process module to execute the iptables command-line tool with various arguments to manage the iptables rules. The first command blocks incoming SSH connections from IP address 1.2.3.4, the second command allows incoming HTTP connections, and the third command sets the default policy for incoming traffic to DROP, effectively blocking all other incoming traffic. Note that this script assumes that the iptables rules are not currently managed by any other software or script.
